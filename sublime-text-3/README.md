# sublime-text-3 snap

This project creates a working snap of sublime-text-3.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - add custom launcher done by desktop/qt5
 - build the file from the tarball : https://download.sublimetext.com/sublime_text_3_build_3114_x64.tar.bz2

## Current state

Working features:
 - can be launch from the command-line (very slow)

Known issues:
  - The snap is not found by Unity
  - Package browser not working

TODO:
